# Verilog_Calculator
I have created a simple calculator using verillog's gate level modelling. This code uses many logic gates  such as AND,OR,etc with many logic gates such as full adders. 
The division part has been written in behavior modelling because of the complexity which arises if gate level modelling is used.
